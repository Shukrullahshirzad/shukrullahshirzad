# Shukrullah Shirzad Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, rebuilt and upgraded from my previous vanilla JavaScript version to use **React** and **Vite** for a modern, fast, and maintainable experience.

## About This Project

This site showcases my work, skills, and projects as a developer and creative professional. The upgrade to React brings improved performance, component-based architecture, and easier maintenance. Vite is used for lightning-fast development and build tooling.

### Key Features

- Modern React (with functional components and hooks)
- Fast development and hot module replacement with Vite
- Responsive design and clean UI
- Modular, maintainable codebase
- Upgraded from a vanilla JavaScript implementation

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Folder Structure

- `src/` — React components, styles, and assets
- `public/` — Static files
- `index.html` — Main HTML file

## Previous Version

This project is an upgrade of my old portfolio website, which was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The new version leverages the power of React for a better developer and user experience.
